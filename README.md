# Wishful_Agent
This is a prototypic implementation of an agent allowing a Wishful Controller
to control nCentric mesh node devices.

The nCentric node is a meshing network device which allows Wireless Testbed experimentation in a mobile way.
Controlling is achieved by this agent which acts as a wrapper between a Wishful controller and the nCentric Meshing Application.

This software is designed as an OpenWrt package, allowing easy integration into the OpenWrt build system.
